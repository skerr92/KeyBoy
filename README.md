### About ###
This repository holds all things for the KeyBoy. 

Currently we just have the EAGLE schematic and board files available, thoguh KiCAD files will be coming soon.

Additionally, the BOM and manufacturing files will be coming once with final design is validated.

Once you have hardware in hand, you will need to put the CircuitPython ESP32-S3 Mini Dev Kit image onto the ESP32-S3 onboard.

From there, copy over the required libraries listed in the code.py under the Firmware directory.

Copy the code.py file to your CIRCUITPY drive and it should work.

The game in the code.py is a time dot chase game.

This uses a 1.3" ST7789 display which can be purchased from Adafruit.

### 3D Printed Case ###
Once I receive the next iteration of the board, I will be uploading a usable case here that can be printed on either resin or FDM 3D printers.
A CircuitPython board definition will be coming soon.
